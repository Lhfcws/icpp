First day of my formal internship is so free and boring, and I have to learn C-language deeply. So I wrote this simple interpreter in the afternoon.

## Installation

I haven't add python setup utils into the project, so just `python main.py` in the scripts.

Or if you want a better experience, add the following alias in `~/.bashrc`:

    alias icpp='python /path/to/main.py'
    source ~/.bashrc

Then you can use `icpp` in anywhere in your shell.

**Read `help.md` to learn how to use `icpp`.**
